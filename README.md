# About CuDi

Cudi is a custom dictionary and a words manager. You can add your own words and translations(it doesn't provide any languages). With this program you're able to create a list of words and translations for them and save it into a *.cudi file. I created this because I needed a place to keep my words in one place(I'm learning spanish right now). I'm planning to add a quiz test from form list that you provide.

# Platform
It's written on Linux right now but I will build it for Windows later too.
